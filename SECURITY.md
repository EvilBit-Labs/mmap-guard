## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of mmap-guard seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, use one of the following channels:

1. [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/EvilBit-Labs/mmap-guard/security/advisories/new) (preferred)
2. Email [support@evilbitlabs.io](mailto:support@evilbitlabs.io) encrypted with our [PGP key](#pgp-key) (verify the full fingerprint below before use)

Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Scope

**In scope:**

- Unsound behavior in the `unsafe` block (use-after-unmap, mutable aliasing)
- Bypasses of pre-flight safety checks (empty file, permission errors)
- Denial of service via crafted file inputs
- Path traversal in file path handling
- Unsafe code in dependencies that affects mmap-guard

**Out of scope:**

- SIGBUS from concurrent file truncation by another process (documented known limitation)
- Vulnerabilities in the underlying `memmap2` crate (report upstream)
- Issues requiring physical access to the machine
- Social engineering attacks

### What to Expect

**Note**: This is a passion project with volunteer maintainers. Response times are best-effort and may vary based on maintainer availability.

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **1 week**
- We will provide an initial assessment within **2 weeks**
- We aim to release a fix within **90 days** of confirmed vulnerabilities
- We will coordinate disclosure through a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/EvilBit-Labs/mmap-guard/security/advisories)
- We will credit you in the advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to respond to issues before any disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying other users' data
- Avoid actions that could negatively impact other users

## Security Features

mmap-guard includes several security-focused features:

- **Isolated unsafe boundary**: Exactly one `unsafe` block, fully documented with a `// SAFETY:` comment
- **Strict linting**: `#![deny(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)]`, pedantic/nursery/cargo clippy groups, `unwrap_used` denied, `panic` denied
- **Pre-flight checks**: Empty file detection and permission validation before mapping
- **Read-only mappings**: No mutable or writable mappings are created
- **Dependency auditing**: Regular `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` checks
- **Automated dependency updates**: Via Dependabot

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Report vulnerabilities through the channels described above

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy.
